R formula as a character string or a formula. This is used to transform the input dataframe before fitting, see ft_r_formula for details. |\n| num_trees | Number of trees to train (>= 1). If 1, then no bootstrapping is used. If > 1, then bootstrapping is done. |\n| subsampling_rate | Fraction of the training data used for learning each decision tree, in range (0, 1]. (default = 1.0) |\n| max_depth | Maximum depth of the tree (>= 0); that is, the maximum number of nodes separating any leaves from the root of the tree. |\n| min_instances_per_node | Minimum number of instances each child must have after split. |\n| feature_subset_strategy | The number of features to consider for splits at each tree node. See details for options. |\n| impurity | Criterion used for information gain calculation. Supported: \"entropy\" and \"gini\" (default) for classification and \"variance\" (default) for regression. For `ml_decision_tree`, setting `\"auto\"` will default to the appropriate criterion based on model type. |\n| min_info_gain | Minimum information gain for a split to be considered at a tree node. Should be >= 0, defaults to 0. |\n| max_bins | The maximum number of bins used for discretizing continuous features and for choosing how to split on features at each node. More bins give higher granularity. |\n| seed | Seed for random numbers. |\n| thresholds | Thresholds in multi-class classification to adjust the probability of predicting each class. Array must have length equal to the number of classes, with values > 0 excepting that at most one value may be 0. The class with largest value `p/t` is predicted, where `p` is the original probability of that class and `t` is the class's threshold. |\n| checkpoint_interval | Set checkpoint interval (>= 1) or disable checkpoint (-1). E.g. 10 means that the cache will get checkpointed every 10 iterations, defaults to 10. |\n| cache_node_ids | If `FALSE`, the algorithm will pass trees to executors to match instances with nodes. If `TRUE`, the algorithm will cache node IDs for each instance. Caching can speed up training of deeper trees. Defaults to `FALSE`. |\n| max_memory_in_mb | Maximum memory in MB allocated to histogram aggregation. If too small, then 1 node will be split per iteration, and its aggregates may exceed this size. Defaults to 256. |\n| features_col | Features column name, as a length-one character vector. The column should be single vector column of numeric values. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| label_col | Label column name. The column should be a numeric column. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| prediction_col | Prediction column name. |\n| probability_col | Column name for predicted class conditional probabilities. |\n| raw_prediction_col | Raw prediction (a.k.a. confidence) column name. |\n| uid | A character string used to uniquely identify the ML estimator. |\n| ... | Optional arguments; see Details. |\n| type | The type of model to fit. `\"regression\"` treats the response as a continuous variable, while `\"classification\"` treats the response as a categorical variable. When `\"auto\"` is used, the model type is inferred based on the response variable type -- if it is a numeric type, then regression is used; classification otherwise. |\n| response | (Deprecated) The name of the response column (as a length-one character vector.) |\n| features | (Deprecated) The name of features (terms) to use for the model fit. |\n\n## Details\n\n The supported options for `feature_subset_strategy` are        \n\n- `\"auto\"`: Choose automatically for task: If `num_trees == 1`, set to `\"all\"`. If `num_trees > 1` (forest), set to `\"sqrt\"` for classification and to `\"onethird\"` for regression.     \n\n- `\"all\"`: use all features     \n\n- `\"onethird\"`: use 1/3 of the features     \n\n- `\"sqrt\"`: use use sqrt(number of features)     \n\n- `\"log2\"`: use log2(number of features)     \n\n- `\"n\"`: when `n` is in the range (0, 1.0], use n * number of features. When `n` is in the range (1, number of features), use `n` features. (default = `\"auto\"`)     \n\n  `ml_random_forest` is a wrapper around `ml_random_forest_regressor.tbl_spark` and `ml_random_forest_classifier.tbl_spark` and calls the appropriate method based on model type. \n\n\n## Value\n The object returned depends on the class of `x`. If it is a `spark_connection`, the function returns a `ml_estimator` object. If it is a `ml_pipeline`, it will return a pipeline with the predictor appended to it. If a `tbl_spark`, it will return a `tbl_spark` with the predictions added to it. \n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sparklyr)\n \nsc <- spark_connect(master = \"local\") \niris_tbl <- sdf_copy_to(sc, iris, name = \"iris_tbl\", overwrite = TRUE) \n \npartitions <- iris_tbl %>% \n  sdf_random_split(training = 0.7, test = 0.3, seed = 1111) \n \niris_training <- partitions$training \niris_test <- partitions$test \n \nrf_model <- iris_training %>% \n  ml_random_forest(Species ~ ., type = \"classification\") \n \npred <- ml_predict(rf_model, iris_test) \n \nml_multiclass_classification_evaluator(pred) \n \n```\n:::\n\n\n## See Also\n Other ml algorithms:  `ml_aft_survival_regression()`, `ml_decision_tree_classifier()`, `ml_gbt_classifier()`, `ml_generalized_linear_regression()`, `ml_isotonic_regression()`, `ml_linear_regression()`, `ml_linear_svc()`, `ml_logistic_regression()`, `ml_multilayer_perceptron_classifier()`, `ml_naive_bayes()`, `ml_one_vs_rest()` \n\n\n\n",
