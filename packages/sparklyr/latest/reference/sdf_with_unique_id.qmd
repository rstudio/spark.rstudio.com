## sdf_with_unique_id

## Description
Add a unique ID column to a Spark DataFrame. The Spark `monotonicallyIncreasingId` function is used to produce these and is guaranteed to produce unique, monotonically increasing ids; however, there is no guarantee that these IDs will be sequential. The table is persisted immediately after the column is generated, to ensure that the column is stable -- otherwise, it can differ across new computations. 


## Usage
```r
sdf_with_unique_id(x, id = "id") 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | A `spark_connection`, `ml_pipeline`, or a `tbl_spark`. |
| id | The name of the column to host the generated IDs. |
