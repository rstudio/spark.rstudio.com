Also known as `spark.kubernetes.container.image`. |\n| driver | Name of the driver pod. If not set, the driver pod name is set to \"sparklyr\" suffixed by id to avoid name conflicts. Also known as `spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name`. |\n| account | Service account that is used when running the driver pod. The driver pod uses this service account when requesting executor pods from the API server. Also known as `spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName`. |\n| jars | Path to the sparklyr jars; either, a local path inside the container image with the sparklyr jars copied when the image was created or, a path accesible by the container where the sparklyr jars were copied. You can find a path to the sparklyr jars by running `system.file(\"java/\", package = \"sparklyr\")`. |\n| forward | Should ports used in sparklyr be forwarded automatically through Kubernetes? Default to `TRUE` which runs `kubectl port-forward` and `pkill kubectl` on disconnection. |\n| executors | Number of executors to request while connecting. |\n| conf | A named list of additional entries to add to `sparklyr.shell.conf`. |\n| timeout | Total seconds to wait before giving up on connection. |\n| ports | Ports to forward using kubectl. |\n| fix_config | Should the spark-defaults.conf get fixed? `TRUE` for Windows. |\n| ... | Additional parameters, currently not in use. |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
