## Overview

This documentation demonstrates how to use `sparklyr` with Apache Spark in
Databricks along with RStudio Team, RStudio Server Pro, RStudio Connect, and
RStudio Package Manager.

## Using RStudio Team with Databricks

RStudio Team is a bundle of our popular professional software for developing
data science projects, publishing data products, and managing packages.

RStudio Team and `sparklyr` can be used with Databricks to work with large
datasets and distributed computations with Apache Spark. The most common use
case is to perform interactive analysis and exploratory development with RStudio
Server Pro and `sparklyr`; write out the results to a database, file system, or
cloud storage; then publish apps, reports, and APIs to RStudio Connect that
query and access the results.

The sections below describe best practices and different options for configuring
specific RStudio products to work with Databricks.

## Best practices for working with Databricks

- **Maintain separate installation environments** - Install RStudio Server Pro,
  RStudio Connect, and RStudio Package Manager outside of the Databricks cluster
  so that they are not limited to the compute resources or ephemeral nature of
  Databricks clusters.
- **Connect to Databricks remotely** - Work with Databricks as a remote compute
  resource, similar to how you would connect remotely to external databases,
  data sources, and storage systems. This can be accomplished using Databricks
  Connect (as described in the
  [Connecting to Databricks remotely](#option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely)
  section below) or by performing SQL queries with JDBC/ODBC using the
  Databricks Spark SQL Driver on
  [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html) or
  [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi).
- **Restrict workloads to interactive analysis** - Only perform workloads
  related to exploratory or interactive analysis with Spark, then write the
  results to a database, file system, or cloud storage for more efficient
  retrieval in apps, reports, and APIs.
- **Load and query results efficiently** - Because of the nature of Spark
  computations and the associated overhead, Shiny apps that use Spark on the
  backend tend to have performance and runtime issues; consider reading the
  results from a database, file system, or cloud storage instead.

## Using RStudio Server Pro with Databricks

There are two options for using `sparklyr` and RStudio Server Pro with
Databricks:

- Option 1:
  [Connecting to Databricks remotely](#option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely)
  (Recommended Option)
- Option 2:
  [Working inside of Databricks](#option-2---working-inside-of-databricks)
  (Alternative Option)

### Option 1 - Connecting to Databricks remotely

With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Spark
cluster and allows users to connect to Spark remotely using `sparklyr` with
[Databricks Connect](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html).

This is the recommended configuration because it targets separate environments,
involves a typical configuration process, avoids resource contention, and allows
RStudio Server Pro to connect to Databricks as well as other remote storage and
compute resources.

</a>

### Option 2 - Working inside of Databricks

If you cannot work with Spark remotely, you should install RStudio Server Pro on
the Driver node of a long-running, persistent Databricks cluster as opposed to a
worker node or an ephemeral cluster.

With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed on the Spark driver
node and allows users to connect to Spark locally using `sparklyr`.

This configuration can result in increased complexity, limited connectivity to
other storage and compute resources, resource contention between RStudio Server
Pro and Databricks, and maintenance concerns due to the ephemeral nature of
Databricks clusters.

## Using RStudio Connect with Databricks

The server environment within Databricks clusters is not permissive enough to
support RStudio Connect or the process sandboxing mechanisms that it uses to
isolate published content.

Therefore, the only supported configuration is to install RStudio Connect
outside of the Databricks cluster and connect to Databricks remotely.

Whether RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Databricks cluster
(Recommended Option) or within the Databricks cluster (Alternative Option), you
can publish content to RStudio Connect as long as HTTP/HTTPS network traffic is
allowed from RStudio Server Pro to RStudio Connect.

There are two options for using RStudio Connect with Databricks:

1. [Performing SQL queries with ODBC using the Databricks Spark SQL Driver](/examples/databricks-cluster-odbc) 
   (Recommended Option).
2. Adding calls in your R code to create and run Databricks jobs
   [with bricksteR and the Databricks Jobs API](https://github.com/RafiKurlansik/bricksteR/)
   (Alternative Option)

## Using RStudio Package Manager with Databricks

Whether RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Databricks cluster
(Recommended Option) or within the Databricks cluster (Alternative Option), you
can install packages from repositories in RStudio Package Manager as long as
HTTP/HTTPS network traffic is allowed from RStudio Server Pro to RStudio Package
Manager.
