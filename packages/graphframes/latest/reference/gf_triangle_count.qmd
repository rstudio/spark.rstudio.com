## gf_triangle_count

## Description
This algorithm ignores edge direction; i.e., all edges are treated   as undirected. In a multigraph, duplicate edges will be counted only once. 


## Usage
```r
gf_triangle_count(x, ...) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | An object coercable to a GraphFrame (typically, a `gf_graphframe`). |
| ... | Optional arguments, currently not used. |





## Examples
```{r, eval=ecodown::examples_not_run()}
library(graphframes)
g <- gf_friends(sc) 
gf_triangle_count(g) 
```
