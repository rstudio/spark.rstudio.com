Today we are excited to share that a new release of sparklyr is available on CRAN! This 0.9 release enables you to:

- Create **Spark structured streams** to process real time data from many data sources using dplyr, SQL, pipelines, and arbitrary R code.
- Monitor **connection progress with upcoming RStudio Preview 1.2** features and support for properly interrupting Spark jobs from R.
- Use **Kubernetes** clusters with sparklyr to simplify deployment and maintenance.
