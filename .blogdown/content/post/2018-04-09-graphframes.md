We are very excited to announce that the [graphframes](https://github.com/rstudio/graphframes) package is now on CRAN!  


### What does `graphframes` do?

- It adds support for [GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/) which aims to provide the functionality of [GraphX](http://spark.apache.org/graphx/).
- Perform graph algorithms like: [PageRank](https://graphframes.github.io/api/scala/index.html#org.graphframes.lib.PageRank), [ShortestPaths](https://graphframes.github.io/api/scala/index.html#org.graphframes.lib.ShortestPaths) and many [others](https://graphframes.github.io/api/scala/#package).
- Designed to work with [sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com) and the [sparklyr extensions](http://spark.rstudio.com/extensions.html).

### New article

A new article has been added to the site that walk through how to get started with Graph Analysis inside Spark: [R interface for GraphFrames](/graphframes)
