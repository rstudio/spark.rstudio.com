## tbl_cache

## Description
Force a Spark table with name `name` to be loaded into memory. Operations on cached tables should normally (although not always) be more performant than the same operation performed on an uncached table.


## Usage
```r
tbl_cache(sc, name, force = TRUE)
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| sc | A `spark_connection`. |
| name | The table name. |
| force | Force the data to be loaded into memory? This is accomplished by calling the `count` API on the associated Spark DataFrame. |
