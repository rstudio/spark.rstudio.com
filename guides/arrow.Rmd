## Introduction 

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. Arrow is supported starting with `sparklyr 1.0.0` to improve performance when transferring data between Spark and R. You can find some performance benchmarks under:

- [sparklyr 1.0: Arrow, XGBoost, Broom and TFRecords](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/03/04/sparklyr-1-0/).
- [Speeding up R and Apache Spark using Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/01/25/r-spark-improvements/).

## Installation

Install the latest release of `arrow` from CRAN with

```
install.packages("arrow")
```

Please see https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r if you have any question about using `arrow` from R.

## Use Cases

There are three main use cases for `arrow` in `sparklyr`:

- **Data Copying**: When copying data with `copy_to()`, Arrow will be used.
- **Data Collection**: Also, when collecting either, implicitly by printing datasets or explicitly calling `collect`.
- **R Transformations**: When using `spark_apply()`, data will be transferred using Arrow when possible.

To use `arrow` in `sparklyr` one simply needs to import this library:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(arrow)
```
```
Attaching package: ‘arrow’

The following object is masked from ‘package:utils’:

    timestamp

The following objects are masked from ‘package:base’:

    array, table
```

## Considerations

### Types

Some data types are mapped to slightly different, one can argue more correct, types when using Arrow. For instance, consider collecting 64 bit integers in `sparklyr`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sparklyr)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")
integer64 <- sdf_len(sc, 2, type = "integer64")
integer64
```
```
# Source: spark<?> [?? x 1]
     id
  <dbl>
1     1
2     2
```

Notice that `sparklyr` collects 64 bit integers as `double`; however, using `arrow`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(arrow)
integer64
```
```
# Source: spark<?> [?? x 1]
  id             
  <S3: integer64>
1 1              
2 2 
```

64 bit integers are now being collected as proper 64 bit integer using the `bit64` package.

### Fallback

The Arrow R package supports many data types; however, in cases where a type is unsupported, `sparklyr` will fallback to not using arrow and print a warning.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sparklyr.nested)
library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr)
library(arrow)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")
cars <- copy_to(sc, mtcars)

sdf_nest(cars, hp) %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(data = collect_list(data))
```
```
# Source: spark<?> [?? x 2]
    cyl data       
  <dbl> <list>     
1     6 <list [7]> 
2     4 <list [11]>
3     8 <list [14]>
Warning message:
In arrow_enabled_object.spark_jobj(sdf) :
  Arrow disabled due to columns: data
```
