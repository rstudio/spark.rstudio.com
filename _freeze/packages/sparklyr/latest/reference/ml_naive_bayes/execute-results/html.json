It supports Multinomial NB (see [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/naive-bayes-text-classification-1.html)) which can handle finitely supported discrete data. For example, by converting documents into TF-IDF vectors, it can be used for document classification. By making every vector a binary (0/1) data, it can also be used as Bernoulli NB (see [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/the-bernoulli-model-1.html)). The input feature values must be nonnegative. \n\n\n## Usage\n```r\nml_naive_bayes( \n  x, \n  formula = NULL, \n  model_type = \"multinomial\", \n  smoothing = 1, \n  thresholds = NULL, \n  weight_col = NULL, \n  features_col = \"features\", \n  label_col = \"label\", \n  prediction_col = \"prediction\", \n  probability_col = \"probability\", \n  raw_prediction_col = \"rawPrediction\", \n  uid = random_string(\"naive_bayes_\"), \n  ... \n) \n```\n\n## Arguments\n|Arguments|Description|\n|---|---|\n| x | A `spark_connection`, `ml_pipeline`, or a `tbl_spark`. |\n| formula | Used when `x` is a `tbl_spark`. R formula as a character string or a formula. This is used to transform the input dataframe before fitting, see ft_r_formula for details. |\n| model_type | The model type. Supported options: `\"multinomial\"`<br>and `\"bernoulli\"`. (default = `multinomial`) |\n| smoothing | The (Laplace) smoothing parameter. Defaults to 1. |\n| thresholds | Thresholds in multi-class classification to adjust the probability of predicting each class. Array must have length equal to the number of classes, with values > 0 excepting that at most one value may be 0. The class with largest value `p/t` is predicted, where `p` is the original probability of that class and `t` is the class's threshold. |\n| weight_col | (Spark 2.1.0+) Weight column name. If this is not set or empty, we treat all instance weights as 1.0. |\n| features_col | Features column name, as a length-one character vector. The column should be single vector column of numeric values. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| label_col | Label column name. The column should be a numeric column. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| prediction_col | Prediction column name. |\n| probability_col | Column name for predicted class conditional probabilities. |\n| raw_prediction_col | Raw prediction (a.k.a. confidence) column name. |\n| uid | A character string used to uniquely identify the ML estimator. |\n| ... | Optional arguments; see Details. |\n\n## Details\nWhen `x` is a `tbl_spark` and `formula` (alternatively, `response` and `features`) is specified, the function returns a `ml_model` object wrapping a `ml_pipeline_model` which contains data pre-processing transformers, the ML predictor, and, for classification models, a post-processing transformer that converts predictions into class labels. For classification, an optional argument `predicted_label_col` (defaults to `\"predicted_label\"`) can be used to specify the name of the predicted label column. In addition to the fitted `ml_pipeline_model`, `ml_model` objects also contain a `ml_pipeline` object where the ML predictor stage is an estimator ready to be fit against data. This is utilized by `ml_save` with `type = \"pipeline\"` to faciliate model refresh workflows. \n\n\n## Value\n\nThe object returned depends on the class of `x`. \n\n  \n\n- `spark_connection`: When `x` is a `spark_connection`, the function returns an instance of a `ml_estimator` object. The object contains a pointer to   a Spark `Predictor` object and can be used to compose   `Pipeline` objects. \n\n  \n\n- `ml_pipeline`: When `x` is a `ml_pipeline`, the function returns a `ml_pipeline` with   the predictor appended to the pipeline. \n\n  \n\n- `tbl_spark`: When `x` is a `tbl_spark`, a predictor is constructed then   immediately fit with the input `tbl_spark`, returning a prediction model. \n\n  \n\n- `tbl_spark`, with `formula`: specified When `formula`\n\n    is specified, the input `tbl_spark` is first transformed using a     `RFormula` transformer before being fit by     the predictor. The object returned in this case is a `ml_model` which is a     wrapper of a `ml_pipeline_model`. \n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sparklyr)\nsc <- spark_connect(master = \"local\") \niris_tbl <- sdf_copy_to(sc, iris, name = \"iris_tbl\", overwrite = TRUE) \npartitions <- iris_tbl %>% \n  sdf_random_split(training = 0.7, test = 0.3, seed = 1111) \niris_training <- partitions$training \niris_test <- partitions$test \nnb_model <- iris_training %>% \n  ml_naive_bayes(Species ~ .) \npred <- ml_predict(nb_model, iris_test) \nml_multiclass_classification_evaluator(pred) \n```\n:::\n\n\n## See Also\n\nSee [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html) for   more information on the set of supervised learning algorithms. \n\nOther ml algorithms:  `ml_aft_survival_regression()`, `ml_decision_tree_classifier()`, `ml_gbt_classifier()`, `ml_generalized_linear_regression()`, `ml_isotonic_regression()`, `ml_linear_regression()`, `ml_linear_svc()`, `ml_logistic_regression()`, `ml_multilayer_perceptron_classifier()`, `ml_one_vs_rest()`, `ml_random_forest_classifier()`\n\n",
