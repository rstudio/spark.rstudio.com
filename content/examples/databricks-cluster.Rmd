## Overview

This documentation demonstrates how to use `sparklyr` with RStudio Server Pro,
RStudio Connect, and RStudio Package Manager to work with Databricks.

## Best practices

- **Maintain separate installation environments** - Install RStudio Server Pro,
  RStudio Connect, and RStudio Package Manager outside of the Databricks cluster
  so that they are not limited to the compute resources or ephemeral nature of
  Databricks clusters.
- **Connect to Databricks remotely** - Work with Databricks as a remote compute
  resource, similar to how you would connect remotely to external databases,
  data sources, and storage systems. This can be accomplished using Databricks
  Connect (as described in the
  [Connecting to Databricks remotely](#option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely)
  section below) or by performing SQL queries with JDBC/ODBC using the
  Databricks Spark SQL Driver on
  [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html) or
  [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi).
- **Restrict workloads to interactive analysis** - Only perform workloads
  related to exploratory or interactive analysis with Spark, then write the
  results to a database, file system, or cloud storage for more efficient
  retrieval in apps, reports, and APIs.
- **Load and query results efficiently** - Because of the nature of Spark
  computations and the associated overhead, Shiny apps that use Spark on the
  backend tend to have performance and runtime issues; consider reading the
  results from a database, file system, or cloud storage instead.

## Using RStudio Server Pro with Databricks

There are two options for using `sparklyr` and RStudio Server Pro with
Databricks:

- Option 1:
  [Connecting to Databricks remotely](#option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely)
  (Recommended Option)
- Option 2:
  [Working inside of Databricks](#option-2---working-inside-of-databricks)
  (Alternative Option)

### Option 1 - Connecting to Databricks remotely

With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Spark
cluster and allows users to connect to Spark remotely using `sparklyr` with
[Databricks Connect](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html).

This is the recommended configuration because it targets separate environments,
involves a typical configuration process, avoids resource contention, and allows
RStudio Server Pro to connect to Databricks as well as other remote storage and
compute resources.

### Option 2 - Working inside of Databricks

If you cannot work with Spark remotely, you should install RStudio Server Pro on
the Driver node of a long-running, persistent Databricks cluster as opposed to a
worker node or an ephemeral cluster.

With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed on the Spark driver
node and allows users to connect to Spark locally using `sparklyr`.

This configuration can result in increased complexity, limited connectivity to
other storage and compute resources, resource contention between RStudio Server
Pro and Databricks, and maintenance concerns due to the ephemeral nature of
Databricks clusters.

## Using RStudio Connect with Databricks

The server environment within Databricks clusters is not permissive enough to
support RStudio Connect or the process sandboxing mechanisms that it uses to
isolate published content.

Therefore, the only supported configuration is to install RStudio Connect
outside of the Databricks cluster and connect to Databricks remotely.

Whether RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Databricks cluster
(Recommended Option) or within the Databricks cluster (Alternative Option), you
can publish content to RStudio Connect as long as HTTP/HTTPS network traffic is
allowed from RStudio Server Pro to RStudio Connect.

There are two options for using RStudio Connect with Databricks:

1. Performing SQL queries with JDBC/ODBC using the Databricks Spark SQL Driver
   on [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html) or
   [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi)
   (Recommended Option)
2. Adding calls in your R code to create and run Databricks jobs
   [with bricksteR and the Databricks Jobs API](https://github.com/RafiKurlansik/bricksteR/)
   (Alternative Option)

## Using RStudio Package Manager with Databricks

Whether RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Databricks cluster
(Recommended Option) or within the Databricks cluster (Alternative Option), you
can install packages from repositories in RStudio Package Manager as long as
HTTP/HTTPS network traffic is allowed from RStudio Server Pro to RStudio Package
Manager.
