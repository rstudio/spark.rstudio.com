## Overview

This configuration details how to connect to Databricks using an ODBC
connection. With this setup, R can connect to Databricks using the
[`odbc`](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc) and [`DBI`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/) R
packages. This type of configuration is the recommended approach for
connecting to Databricks from RStudio Connect and can also be used from
RStudio Workbench.

## Advantages and limitations

Advantages:

- ODBC connections tend to be more stable than Spark connections. This is
especially beneficial for content published to RStudio Connect.
- If code is developed using a Spark connection and `sparklyr`, it is easy to
swap out the connection type for an ODBC connection and the remaining code
will still run.
- The Spark ODBC driver provided by Databricks was benchmarked against a
native Spark connection and the performance of the two is very comparable.

Limitations:
- Not all Spark features and functions are available through an ODBC connection.

## Driver installation

[Download and install the Spark ODBC driver from
Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#step-1-download-and-install-a-jdbc-or-odbc-driver)
  
## Driver configuration

[Create a DSN for Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#configure-odbc-data-source-name-for-the-simba-odbc-driver).

```
[Databricks-Spark]
Driver=Simba
Server=<server-hostname>
HOST=<server-hostname>
PORT=<port>
SparkServerType=3
Schema=default
ThriftTransport=2
SSL=1
AuthMech=3
UID=token
PWD=<personal-access-token>
HTTPPath=<http-path>
```

## Connect to Databricks

The connection can be tested from the command line using `isql -v
Databricks-Spark` where `Databricks-Spark` is the DSN name for the
connection. If that connects successfully, then the following code can be
used to create a connection from an R session:

```
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

con <- dbConnect(odbc(), "Databricks-Spark")
```
