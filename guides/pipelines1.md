Spark ML Pipelines
================

Spark’s **ML Pipelines** provide a way to easily combine multiple
transformations and algorithms into a single workflow, or pipeline.

For R users, the insights gathered during the interactive sessions with
Spark can now be converted to a formal pipeline. This makes the hand-off
from Data Scientists to Big Data Engineers a lot easier, this is because
there should not be additional changes needed to be made by the later
group.

The final list of selected variables, data manipulation, feature
transformations and modeling can be easily re-written into a
`ml_pipeline()` object, saved, and ultimately placed into a Production
environment. The `sparklyr` output of a saved Spark ML Pipeline object
is in Scala code, which means that the code can be added to the
scheduled Spark ML jobs, and without any dependencies in R.

Introduction to ML Pipelines
----------------------------

The official Apache Spark site contains a more complete overview of [ML
Pipelines](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-pipeline.html). This
article will focus in introducing the basic concepts and steps to work
with ML Pipelines via `sparklyr`.

There are two important stages in building an ML Pipeline. The first one
is creating a **Pipeline**. A good way to look at it, or call it, is as
an **“empty” pipeline**. This step just builds the steps that the data
will go through. This is the somewhat equivalent of doing this in R:

    r_pipeline <-  . %>% mutate(cyl = paste0("c", cyl)) %>% lm(am ~ cyl + mpg, data = .)
    r_pipeline

    ## Functional sequence with the following components:
    ## 
    ##  1. mutate(., cyl = paste0("c", cyl))
    ##  2. lm(am ~ cyl + mpg, data = .)
    ## 
    ## Use 'functions' to extract the individual functions.

The `r_pipeline` object has all the steps needed to transform and fit
the model, but it has not yet transformed any data.

The second step, is to pass data through the pipeline, which in turn
will output a fitted model. That is called a **PipelineModel**. The
**PipelineModel** can then be used to produce predictions.

    r_model <- r_pipeline(mtcars)
    r_model

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = am ~ cyl + mpg, data = .)
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ## (Intercept)        cylc6        cylc8          mpg  
    ##    -0.54388      0.03124     -0.03313      0.04767

### Taking advantage of Pipelines and PipelineModels

The two stage ML Pipeline approach produces two final data products:

-   A **PipelineModel** that can be added to the daily Spark jobs which
    will produce new predictions for the incoming data, and again, with
    no R dependencies.

-   A **Pipeline** that can be **easily re-fitted** on a regular
    interval, say every month. All that is needed is to pass a new
    sample to obtain the new coefficients.

Pipeline
--------

An additional goal of this article is that the reader can follow along,
so the data, transformations and Spark connection in this example will
be kept as easy to reproduce as possible.

    library(nycflights13)
    library(sparklyr)
    library(dplyr)
    sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", spark_version = "2.2.0")

    ## * Using Spark: 2.2.0

    spark_flights <- sdf_copy_to(sc, flights)

### Feature Transformers

Pipelines make heavy use of [Feature
Transformers](http://spark.rstudio.com/reference/#section-spark-feature-transformers).
If new to Spark, and `sparklyr`, it would be good to review what these
transformers do. These functions use the Spark API directly to transform
the data, and may be faster at making the data manipulations that a
`dplyr` (SQL) transformation.

In `sparklyr` the `ft` functions are essentially are wrappers to
original [Spark feature
transformer](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html).

### ft\_dplyr\_transformer

This example will start with `dplyr` transformations, which are
ultimately SQL transformations, loaded into the `df` variable.

In `sparklyr`, there is one feature transformer that is not available in
Spark, `ft_dplyr_transformer()`. The goal of this function is to convert
the `dplyr` code to a SQL Feature Transformer that can then be used in a
Pipeline.

    df <- spark_flights %>%
      filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
      mutate(
        month = paste0("m", month),
        day = paste0("d", day)
      ) %>%
      select(dep_delay, sched_dep_time, month, day, distance) 

This is the resulting pipeline stage produced from the `dplyr` code:

    ft_dplyr_transformer(sc, df)

Use the `ml_param()` function to extract the “statement” attribute. That
attribute contains the finalized SQL statement. Notice that the
`flights` table name has been replace with `__THIS__`. This allows the
pipeline to accept different table names as its source, making the
pipeline very modular.

    ft_dplyr_transformer(sc, df) %>%
      ml_param("statement")

    ## [1] "SELECT `dep_delay`, `sched_dep_time`, `month`, `day`, `distance`\nFROM (SELECT `year`, CONCAT(\"m\", `month`) AS `month`, CONCAT(\"d\", `day`) AS `day`, `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, `sched_arr_time`, `arr_delay`, `carrier`, `flight`, `tailnum`, `origin`, `dest`, `air_time`, `distance`, `hour`, `minute`, `time_hour`\nFROM (SELECT *\nFROM `__THIS__`\nWHERE (NOT(((`dep_delay`) IS NULL)))) `bjbujfpqzq`) `axbwotqnbr`"

### Creating the Pipeline

The following step will create a 5 stage pipeline:

1.  SQL transformer - Resulting from the `ft_dplyr_transformer()`
    transformation
2.  Binarizer - To determine if the flight should be considered delay.
    The eventual outcome variable.
3.  Bucketizer - To split the day into specific hour buckets
4.  R Formula - To define the model’s formula
5.  Logistic Model

<!-- -->

    flights_pipeline <- ml_pipeline(sc) %>%
      ft_dplyr_transformer(
        tbl = df
        ) %>%
      ft_binarizer(
        input.col = "dep_delay",
        output.col = "delayed",
        threshold = 15
      ) %>%
      ft_bucketizer(
        input.col = "sched_dep_time",
        output.col = "hours",
        splits = c(400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400)
      )  %>%
      ft_r_formula(delayed ~ month + day + hours + distance) %>% 
      ml_logistic_regression()

Another nice feature for ML Pipelines in `sparklyr`, is the print-out.
It makes it really easy to how each stage is setup:

    flights_pipeline

    ##   |      standardization: TRUE
    ##   |      threshold: 0.5
    ##   |      tol: 1e-06

Notice that there are no *coefficients* defined yet. That’s because no
data has been actually processed. Even though `df` uses
`spark_flights()`, recall that the final SQL transformer makes that
name, so there’s no data to process yet.

PipelineModel
-------------

A quick partition of the data is created for this exercise.

    partitioned_flights <- sdf_partition(
      spark_flights,
      training = 0.01,
      testing = 0.01,
      rest = 0.98
    )

The `ml_fit()` function produces the PipelineModel. The `training`
partition of the `partitioned_flights` data is used to train the model:

    fitted_pipeline <- ml_fit(
      flights_pipeline,
      partitioned_flights$training
    )
    fitted_pipeline

    ##   |      num_features:  int 43 
    ##   |      threshold:  num 0.5

Notice that the print-out for the fitted pipeline now displays the
model’s coefficients.

The `ml_transform()` function can be used to run predictions, in other
words it is used instead of `predict()` or `sdf_predict()`.

    predictions <- ml_transform(
      fitted_pipeline,
      partitioned_flights$testing
    )

    predictions %>%
      group_by(delayed, prediction) %>%
      tally()

    ## # Source:   lazy query [?? x 3]
    ## # Database: spark_connection
    ## # Groups:   delayed
    ##   delayed prediction     n
    ##     <dbl>      <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1      0.         1.   51.
    ## 2      0.         0. 2599.
    ## 3      1.         0.  666.
    ## 4      1.         1.   69.

Save the pipelines to disk
--------------------------

The `ml_save()` command can be used to save the Pipeline and
PipelineModel to disk. The resulting output is a folder with the
selected name, which contains all of the necessary Scala scripts:

    ml_save(
      flights_pipeline,
      "flights_pipeline",
      overwrite = TRUE
    )

    ## NULL

    ml_save(
      fitted_pipeline,
      "flights_model",
      overwrite = TRUE
    )

    ## NULL

Use an existing PipelineModel
-----------------------------

The `ml_load()` command can be used to re-load Pipelines and
PipelineModels. The saved ML Pipeline files can only be loaded into an
open Spark session.

    reloaded_model <- ml_load(sc, "flights_model")

A simple query can be used as the table that will be used to make the
new predictions. This of course, does not have to done in R, at this
time the “flights\_model” can be loaded into an independent Spark
session outside of R.

    new_df <- spark_flights %>%
      filter(
        month == 7,
        day == 5
      )

    ml_transform(reloaded_model, new_df) 

    ## # Source:   table<sparklyr_tmp_24041e052b5> [?? x 12]
    ## # Database: spark_connection
    ##    dep_delay sched_dep_time month day   distance delayed hours features

    ##  2      141.           2245 m7    d5       2475.      1.    4. <dbl [43]>

    ##  9       -7.            600 m7    d5         96.      0.    0. <dbl [43]>
    ## 10       -6.            600 m7    d5        937.      0.    0. <dbl [43]>
    ## # ... with more rows, and 4 more variables: label <dbl>,
    ## #   rawPrediction <list>, probability <list>, prediction <dbl>

Re-fit an existing Pipeline
---------------------------

First, reload the pipeline into an open Spark session:

    reloaded_pipeline <- ml_load(sc, "flights_pipeline")

Use `ml_fit()` again to pass new data, in this case, `sample_frac()` is
used instead of `sdf_partition()` to provide the new data. The idea
being that the re-fitting would happen at a later date than when the
model was initially fitted.

    new_model <-  ml_fit(reloaded_pipeline, sample_frac(spark_flights, 0.01))

    new_model

The new model can be saved using `ml_save()`. A new name is used in this
case, but the same name as the existing PipelineModel to replace it.

    ml_save(new_model, "new_flights_model", overwrite = TRUE)

    ## NULL

Finally, this example is complete by closing the Spark session.

    spark_disconnect(sc)
