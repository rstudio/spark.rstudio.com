## Intro

Snowflake's [Snowpark Connect](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-connect/snowpark-connect-overview)
enables running Spark workloads remotely.  Snowpark Connect for Spark supports 
using the Spark Dataframe API on Snowflake. 

Snowpark Connect is based on Spark Connect. This architecture decouples client 
and server, so that Spark code can run remotely against the Snowflake compute
engine without your needing to manage a Spark cluster.
