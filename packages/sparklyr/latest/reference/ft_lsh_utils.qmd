## Description
Utility functions for LSH models


## Usage
```r
ml_approx_nearest_neighbors(
  model,
  dataset,
  key,
  num_nearest_neighbors,
  dist_col = "distCol"
)

ml_approx_similarity_join(
  model,
  dataset_a,
  dataset_b,
  threshold,
  dist_col = "distCol"
)
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| model | A fitted LSH model, returned by either `ft_minhash_lsh()` or `ft_bucketed_random_projection_lsh()`. |
| dataset | The dataset to search for nearest neighbors of the key. |
| key | Feature vector representing the item to search for. |
| num_nearest_neighbors | The maximum number of nearest neighbors. |
| dist_col | Output column for storing the distance between each result row and the key. |
| dataset_a | One of the datasets to join. |
| dataset_b | Another dataset to join. |
| threshold | The threshold for the distance of row pairs. |
