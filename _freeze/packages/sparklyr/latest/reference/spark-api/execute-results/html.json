These objects provide access to different facets of the Spark API. \n\n\n## Usage\n```r\n \nspark_context(sc) \n \njava_context(sc) \n \nhive_context(sc) \n \nspark_session(sc) \n```\n\n## Arguments\n|Arguments|Description|\n|---|---|\n| sc | A `spark_connection`. |\n\n## Details\n The [Scala API documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/) is useful for discovering what methods are available for each of these objects. Use `invoke` to call methods on these objects. \n\n## Section\n\n## Spark Context\n\n   The main entry point for Spark functionality. The **Spark Context** represents the connection to a Spark cluster, and can be used to create `RDD`s, accumulators and broadcast variables on that cluster. \n\n## Java Spark Context\n\n   A Java-friendly version of the aforementioned **Spark Context**. \n\n## Hive Context\n\n   An instance of the Spark SQL execution engine that integrates with data stored in Hive. Configuration for Hive is read from `hive-site.xml` on the classpath.  Starting with Spark >= 2.0.0, the **Hive Context** class has been deprecated -- it is superceded by the **Spark Session** class, and `hive_context` will return a **Spark Session** object instead. Note that both classes share a SQL interface, and therefore one can invoke SQL through these objects. \n\n## Spark Session\n\n   Available since Spark 2.0.0, the **Spark Session** unifies the **Spark Context** and **Hive Context** classes into a single interface. Its use is recommended over the older APIs for code targeting Spark 2.0.0 and above. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
