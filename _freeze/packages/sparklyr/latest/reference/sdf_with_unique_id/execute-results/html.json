The Spark `monotonicallyIncreasingId` function is used to produce these and is guaranteed to produce unique, monotonically increasing ids; however, there is no guarantee that these IDs will be sequential. The table is persisted immediately after the column is generated, to ensure that the column is stable -- otherwise, it can differ across new computations. \n\n\n## Usage\n```r\n \nsdf_with_unique_id(x, id = \"id\") \n```\n\n## Arguments\n|Arguments|Description|\n|---|---|\n| x | A `spark_connection`, `ml_pipeline`, or a `tbl_spark`. |\n| id | The name of the column to host the generated IDs. |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
