## Overview

Qubole users can request [access to RStudio Server Pro](https://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/user-guide/engines/spark/rstudio_spark.html). This allows users to use [`sparklyr`](https://spark.rstudio.com/) to interact directly with Spark from within the Qubole cluster.

## Advantages and limitations

Advantages:

-   Ability for users to connect `sparklyr` directly to Spark within Qubole
-   Provides a high-bandwidth connection between R and the Spark JVM processes because they are running on the same machine
-   Can load data from the cluster directly into an R session since RStudio Workbench is installed within the Qubole cluster
-   A unique, persistent home directory for each user

Limitations:

-   Persistent packages must be managed using Qubole Environments, not directly from within RStudio
-   RStudio Workbench installed within a Qubole cluster will be limited to the compute resources and lifecycle of that particular Spark cluster
-   Non-Spark jobs will use CPU and RAM resources within the Qubole cluster

## Access RStudio Workbench

RStudio Workbench can be accessed from the cluster resources menu:

## Use `sparklyr`

Use the following R code to establish a connection from `sparklyr` to the Qubole cluster:

``` r
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(method = "qubole")
```

## Additional information

For more information on using RStudio Workbench inside of Qubole, refer to the [Qubole documentation](https://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/user-guide/engines/spark/rstudio_spark.html).
