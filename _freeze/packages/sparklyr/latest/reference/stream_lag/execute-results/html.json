If the any of the time difference(s) between the current and a previous record is greater than the maximal duration allowed, then the previous record is discarded and will not be part of the query result. The durations can be specified with numeric types (which will be interpreted as max difference allowed in number of milliseconds between 2 UNIX timestamps) or time duration strings such as \"5s\", \"5sec\", \"5min\", \"5hour\", etc. Any timestamp column in `x` that is not of timestamp of date Spark SQL types will be interepreted as number of milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n \n \nlibrary(sparklyr) \n \nsc <- spark_connect(master = \"local\", version = \"2.2.0\") \n \nstreaming_path <- tempfile(\"days_df_\") \ndays_df <- dplyr::tibble( \n  today = weekdays(as.Date(seq(7), origin = \"1970-01-01\")) \n) \nnum_iters <- 7 \nstream_generate_test( \n  df = days_df, \n  path = streaming_path, \n  distribution = rep(nrow(days_df), num_iters), \n  iterations = num_iters \n) \n \nstream_read_csv(sc, streaming_path) %>% \n  stream_lag(cols = c(yesterday = today ~ 1, two_days_ago = today ~ 2)) %>% \n  collect() %>% \n  print(n = 10L) \n \n \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n",
