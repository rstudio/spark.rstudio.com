R formula as a character string or a formula. This is used to transform the input dataframe before fitting, see ft_r_formula for details. |\n| censor_col | Censor column name. The value of this column could be 0 or 1. If the value is 1, it means the event has occurred i.e. uncensored; otherwise censored. |\n| quantile_probabilities | Quantile probabilities array. Values of the quantile probabilities array should be in the range (0, 1) and the array should be non-empty. |\n| fit_intercept | Boolean; should the model be fit with an intercept term? |\n| max_iter | The maximum number of iterations to use. |\n| tol | Param for the convergence tolerance for iterative algorithms. |\n| aggregation_depth | (Spark 2.1.0+) Suggested depth for treeAggregate (>= 2). |\n| quantiles_col | Quantiles column name. This column will output quantiles of corresponding quantileProbabilities if it is set. |\n| features_col | Features column name, as a length-one character vector. The column should be single vector column of numeric values. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| label_col | Label column name. The column should be a numeric column. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| prediction_col | Prediction column name. |\n| uid | A character string used to uniquely identify the ML estimator. |\n| ... | Optional arguments; see Details. |\n| response | (Deprecated) The name of the response column (as a length-one character vector.) |\n| features | (Deprecated) The name of features (terms) to use for the model fit. |\n\n## Details\n When `x` is a `tbl_spark` and `formula` (alternatively, `response` and `features`) is specified, the function returns a `ml_model` object wrapping a `ml_pipeline_model` which contains data pre-processing transformers, the ML predictor, and, for classification models, a post-processing transformer that converts predictions into class labels. For classification, an optional argument `predicted_label_col` (defaults to `\"predicted_label\"`) can be used to specify the name of the predicted label column. In addition to the fitted `ml_pipeline_model`, `ml_model` objects also contain a `ml_pipeline` object where the ML predictor stage is an estimator ready to be fit against data. This is utilized by `ml_save` with `type = \"pipeline\"` to faciliate model refresh workflows.  `ml_survival_regression()` is an alias for `ml_aft_survival_regression()` for backwards compatibility. \n\n\n## Value\n\n The object returned depends on the class of `x`.     \n\n- `spark_connection`: When `x` is a `spark_connection`, the function returns an instance of a `ml_estimator` object. The object contains a pointer to   a Spark `Predictor` object and can be used to compose   `Pipeline` objects.    \n\n- `ml_pipeline`: When `x` is a `ml_pipeline`, the function returns a `ml_pipeline` with   the predictor appended to the pipeline.    \n\n- `tbl_spark`: When `x` is a `tbl_spark`, a predictor is constructed then   immediately fit with the input `tbl_spark`, returning a prediction model.    \n\n- `tbl_spark`, with `formula`: specified When `formula`     is specified, the input `tbl_spark` is first transformed using a     `RFormula` transformer before being fit by     the predictor. The object returned in this case is a `ml_model` which is a     wrapper of a `ml_pipeline_model`. \n\n \n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n \n \nlibrary(survival) \nlibrary(sparklyr) \n \nsc <- spark_connect(master = \"local\") \novarian_tbl <- sdf_copy_to(sc, ovarian, name = \"ovarian_tbl\", overwrite = TRUE) \n \npartitions <- ovarian_tbl %>% \n  sdf_random_split(training = 0.7, test = 0.3, seed = 1111) \n \novarian_training <- partitions$training \novarian_test <- partitions$test \n \nsur_reg <- ovarian_training %>% \n  ml_aft_survival_regression(futime ~ ecog_ps + rx + age + resid_ds, censor_col = \"fustat\") \n \npred <- ml_predict(sur_reg, ovarian_test) \npred \n#> # Source: spark<?> [?? x 7]\n#>   futime fustat   age resid_ds    rx ecog_ps prediction\n#>    <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>      <dbl>\n#> 1    115      1  74.5        2     1       1       191.\n#> 2    353      1  63.2        1     2       2      1369.\n#> 3    377      0  58.3        1     2       1      1751.\n#> 4    475      1  59.9        2     2       2       818.\n#> 5    744      0  50.1        1     2       1      2792.\n#> 6    770      0  57.1        2     2       1       928.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## See Also\n See [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-classification-regression.html) for   more information on the set of supervised learning algorithms.
