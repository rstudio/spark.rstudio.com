## register_extension

## Description
Registering an extension package will result in the package being automatically scanned for spark dependencies when a connection to Spark is created. 


## Usage
```r
register_extension(package) 

registered_extensions() 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| package | The package(s) to register. |




## Note
Packages should typically register their extensions in their   `.onLoad` hook -- this ensures that their extensions are registered   when their namespaces are loaded.
