A GMM represents a composite distribution of independent Gaussian distributions with associated \"mixing\" weights specifying each's contribution to the composite. Given a set of sample points, this class will maximize the log-likelihood for a mixture of k Gaussians, iterating until the log-likelihood changes by less than `tol`, or until it has reached the max number of iterations. While this process is generally guaranteed to converge, it is not guaranteed to find a global optimum. \n\n\n## Usage\n```r\n \nml_gaussian_mixture( \n  x, \n  formula = NULL, \n  k = 2, \n  max_iter = 100, \n  tol = 0.01, \n  seed = NULL, \n  features_col = \"features\", \n  prediction_col = \"prediction\", \n  probability_col = \"probability\", \n  uid = random_string(\"gaussian_mixture_\"), \n  ... \n) \n```\n\n## Arguments\n|Arguments|Description|\n|---|---|\n| x | A `spark_connection`, `ml_pipeline`, or a `tbl_spark`. |\n| formula | Used when `x` is a `tbl_spark`. R formula as a character string or a formula. This is used to transform the input dataframe before fitting, see ft_r_formula for details. |\n| k | The number of clusters to create |\n| max_iter | The maximum number of iterations to use. |\n| tol | Param for the convergence tolerance for iterative algorithms. |\n| seed | A random seed. Set this value if you need your results to be reproducible across repeated calls. |\n| features_col | Features column name, as a length-one character vector. The column should be single vector column of numeric values. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| prediction_col | Prediction column name. |\n| probability_col | Column name for predicted class conditional probabilities. Note: Not all models output well-calibrated probability estimates! These probabilities should be treated as confidences, not precise probabilities. |\n| uid | A character string used to uniquely identify the ML estimator. |\n| ... | Optional arguments, see Details. #' @return The object returned depends on the class of `x`. If it is a `spark_connection`, the function returns a `ml_estimator` object. If it is a `ml_pipeline`, it will return a pipeline with the predictor appended to it. If a `tbl_spark`, it will return a `tbl_spark` with the predictions added to it. |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sparklyr)\n \nsc <- spark_connect(master = \"local\") \niris_tbl <- sdf_copy_to(sc, iris, name = \"iris_tbl\", overwrite = TRUE) \n \ngmm_model <- ml_gaussian_mixture(iris_tbl, Species ~ .) \npred <- sdf_predict(iris_tbl, gmm_model) \nml_clustering_evaluator(pred) \n \n \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n",
