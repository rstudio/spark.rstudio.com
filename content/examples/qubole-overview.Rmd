## Overview

This documentation demonstrates how to use `sparklyr` with Apache Spark in
Qubole along with [RStudio Server
Pro](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/) and [RStudio
Connect](https://rstudio.com/products/connect/).

## Best practices for working with Qubole
- **Manage packages via Qubole Environments** - Packages installed via
`install.packages()` are not available on cluster restart. Packages managed
through [Qubole
Environments]((https://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/user-guide/package-management/new-pm-ui.html))
are persistent.
- **Restrict workloads to interactive analysis** - Only perform workloads
  related to exploratory or interactive analysis with Spark, then write the
  results to a database, file system, or cloud storage for more efficient
  retrieval in apps, reports, and APIs.
- **Load and query results efficiently** - Because of the nature of Spark
  computations and the associated overhead, Shiny apps that use Spark on the
  backend tend to have performance and runtime issues; consider reading the
  results from a database, file system, or cloud storage instead. If

## Using RStudio Server Pro with Qubole

Qubole includes RStudio Server Pro as a Beta feature by request. More details
about how to request RStudio Server Pro and access it from within a Qubole
cluster are available [from
Qubole](https://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/user-guide/engines/spark/rstudio_spark.html).

## Using RStudio Connect with Qubole

The best configuration for working with Qubole and RStudio Connect is to install
RStudio Connect outside of the Qubole cluster and connect to Qubole remotely.
This is accomplished using the [Qubole ODBC
Driver](https://docs.qubole.com/en/latest/connectivity-options/use-qubole-drivers/ODBC-driver-linux/index.html).
