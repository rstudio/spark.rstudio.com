title: "Set the SPARK_HOME environment variable"
---

*R/spark_home.R*

## spark_home_set

## Description
Set the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable. This slightly speeds up some operations, including the connection time. 


## Usage
```r
spark_home_set(path = NULL, ...) 
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| path | A string containing the path to the installation location of Spark. If `NULL`, the path to the most latest Spark/Hadoop versions is used. |
| ... | Additional parameters not currently used. |



## Value
The function is mostly invoked for the side-effect of setting the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable. It also returns `TRUE` if the environment was successfully set, and `FALSE` otherwise. 


## Examples
```{r, eval=ecodown::examples_not_run()}
library(sparklyr)
# Not run due to side-effects 
spark_home_set() 
```
