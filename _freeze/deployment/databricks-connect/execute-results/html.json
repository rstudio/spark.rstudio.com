The separation\nbetween client and server allows Spark to be leveraged from everywhere,\nand this would allow R users to interact with a cluster from the comfort\nof their preferred mathine environment. The new [Databricks\nConnect](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html), often \nreferred to as **\"Databricks Connect v2\"**, \navailable in Databricks Runtime version 13 and above, is based on this\nnew architecture.\n\n#### Solution architecture \n\nThe Spark Connect API is very different than the \"legacy\" Spark, using the\nSpark shell is no longer an option. We have decided to use Python as the\ninterface to this new API. In turn, Python uses *gRPC* to interact with Spark. \n\n::: {#fig-connect}\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-width: 12\nflowchart LR\n  subgraph lp[test]\n    subgraph r[R]\n      sr[sparklyr]\n      rt[reticulate]\n    end\n    subgraph  ps[Python]\n      dc[Databricks Connect]\n      g1[gRPC]\n    end\n  end   \n  subgraph db[Databricks]\n    sp[Spark]   \n  end\n  sr <--> rt\n  rt <--> dc\n  g1 <-.

The new\npackage, called `pysparklyr`, is an extension of `sparklyr`.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Package Installation\n\nTo access Databricks Connect, you will need the following two packages:\n\n- `sparklyr` - 1.8.4\n- `pysparklyr` - 0.1.2\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"sparklyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"pysparklyr\")\n```\n\n### Setup credentials\n\nTo use with Databricks Connect, in run-time 13 or above, you will need\nthree configuration items:\n\n1.  Your [Workspace Instance\n    URL](https://docs.databricks.com/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-url) \n1.  Your \n    [Personal Authentication Token](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#pat) (PAT)\n1.   Your \n    [cluster's](https://docs.databricks.com/workspace/workspace-details.html#cluster-url-and-id)\n    ID \n\nWe have developed this solution to align with other R, and non-R, applications that \nintegrate with Databricks. All applications need, at minimum, a work space *(1)*, \nand the authentication token *(2)*. For default values, those applications initially \nlook for these environment variables: \n\n-   `DATABRICKS_HOST` - Your Workspace Instance URL\n-   `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` - Your Personal Authentication Token\n\nEnvironment variables work well, because they rarely vary between projects. The \nthing that will change more often is the cluster you are connecting to. It also \nmakes connection safer, because the token's contents will not be in your code in\nplain text. We recommend that you set  these two variables at your **user level**. \nTo do this run:\n\n```r\nusethis::edit_r_environ()\n```\n\nThat command will open a text file that controls the environment variables at\nthe **user level**. If missing, insert the entries for the two variables:\n\n```bash\nDATABRICKS_HOST=\"Enter here your Workspace URL\"\nDATABRICKS_TOKEN=\"Enter here your personal token\"\n```\n\n**This is a one time operation.** After saving and closing the file, restart your\nR session. \n\n### First time connecting\n\nAfter setting up your Host and Token environment variables, you can now connect\nto your cluster by simply providing the cluster's ID, and the method to \n`spark_connect()`:\n\n``` r\nlibrary(sparklyr)\n\nsc <- spark_connect(\n  cluster_id = \"Enter here your cluster ID\",\n  method = \"databricks_connect\"\n)\n```\n\nIn order to connect and interact with Databricks, you will need a specific set\nof [Python libraries](#additional-setup-details) installed and available. \nTo make it easier to get started, we provide functionality that will \nautomatically do the following:\n\n- Create, or re-create, a Python environment. Based on your OS, it will choose \nto create a Virtual Environment, or Conda.\n\n- Install the needed Python libraries\n\n`spark_connect()` will check to see if you have the expected Python environment,\nand prompt you to accept its installation if missing. Here is an example of \nthe code and output you would expect to see: \n\n```r\nsc <- spark_connect(\n    cluster_id = \"1026-175310-7cpsh3g8\",\n    method = \"databricks_connect\"\n)\n\n#> ! Retrieving version from cluster '1026-175310-7cpsh3g8' \n#> Cluster version: '14.1' \n#> !

After it is done,\nit will attempt to connect to your cluster. Here is an abbreviated example of the\noutput that occurs when selecting \"Yes\": \n\n```r\n#> ✔ Automatically naming the environment:'r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1' \n#> Using Python: /Users/edgar/.pyenv/versions/3.10.13/bin/python3.10 \n#> Creating virtual environment 'r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1' ... \n#> + /Users/edgar/.pyenv/versions/3.10.13/bin/python3.10 -m venv /Users/edgar/.virtualenvs/r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1 \n#> Done! \n#>   Installing packages: pip, wheel, setuptools \n#> + /Users/edgar/.virtualenvs/r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools \n#> Requirement already satisfied: pip in /Users/edgar/.virtualenvs/r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1/lib/python3.10/site-packages (23.0.1) \n#> Collecting pip \n#> Using cached pip-23.3.1-py3-none-any.whl (2.1 MB) \n#> Collecting wheel \n#> Using cached wheel-0.42.0-py3-none-any.whl (65 kB) \n#> Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /Users/edgar/.virtualenvs/r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1/lib/python3.10/site-packages (65.5.0) \n...\n...\n...\n#> Successfully installed PyArrow-14.0.1 cachetools-5.3.2 certifi-2023.11.17 charset-normalizer-3.3.2 databricks-connect-14.1.0 databricks-sdk-0.14.0 google-api-core-2.14.0 google-api-python-client-2.109.0 google-auth-2.25.0 google-auth-httplib2-0.1.1 googleapis-common-protos-1.61.0 grpcio-1.59.3 grpcio_status-1.59.3 httplib2-0.22.0 idna-3.6 numpy-1.26.2 pandas-2.1.3 protobuf-4.25.1 py4j-0.10.9.7 pyasn1-0.5.1 pyasn1-modules-0.3.0 pyparsing-3.1.1 python-dateutil-2.8.2 pytz-2023.3.post1 requests-2.31.0 rsa-4.9 six-1.16.0 tzdata-2023.3 uritemplate-4.1.1 urllib3-2.1.0 \n#> ✔ Using the 'r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1' Python environment \n#> Path: /Users/edgar/.virtualenvs/r-sparklyr-databricks-14.1/bin/python \n```\n\n## Interacting with the cluster\n\n### RStudio's Connection pane\n\nThanks to the new way we are integrating with Spark, it is now possible\nto display the same structure displayed in the Databricks Data Explorer\npage. In Databricks, the current data structure levels are:\n\n-   Catalog\n    -   Database\n        -   Table\n\nIn RStudio, you can navigate the data structure by expanding from the\ntop level, all the way down to the table you wish to explore. Once\nexpanded, the table's fields, and their types are displayed.\n\n![](/images/deployment/connect/rstudio-connection.png)\n\nIn the Connection Pane, you can click on the **table** icon, situated to\nthe right of the table name, to preview the first 1,000 rows:\n\n![](/images/deployment/connect/preview.png)\n\n### Using the Connection to Access Data\n\nAfter connecting, you can use `dbplyr`'s `in_catalog()` function to\naccess any table in your data catalog. You will only need to pass the\nrespective names of the three levels as comma separated character\nentries to `in_catalog()` in this order: Catalog, Database, and Table.\n\nHere is an example of using `tbl()` and `in_catalog()` to point to the\n**trips** table, which is inside **nyctaxi** database, which is a\ndatabase inside the **samples** catalog:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(dbplyr)\nlibrary(sparklyr)\n\nsc <- spark_connect(\n    cluster_id = \"1026-175310-7cpsh3g8\",\n    method = \"databricks_connect\"\n)\n#> !

Here are some of the issues that \nhave been reported to us, and the recommended solution, or workaround.\nEach issue is **collapsed**, just expand it to see the background and \nrecommendation. Each one is titled based on the full error message \nor, the distinctive part of the error message.\n\nBefore reviewing the issues, please make sure to have the latest versions of \n`sparklyr`, and `pysparklyr` from CRAN. These are the current version levels:\n\n- `sparklyr` - 1.8.4\n- `pysparklyr` - 0.1.2\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## `...reticulate can only bind to copies of Python built with '--enable-shared'.`\n\nError message contains:\n\n```r\n... reticulate can only bind to copies of Python built with '--enable-shared'.\n```\n\nThis is happening because there is no Python installation that `reticulate` \ncan use. `pysparklyr` depends on that package to function. \n\n### Solution\n\nThe best way to resolve is to install an acceptable version of Python. You can run:\n\n```r\nreticulate::install_python()\n```\n\nIf the output mentions `--skip-existing [version number]` then you will have two options:\n\n1. If you're ok with replacing the existing Python, then use:\n   ```r\n    reticulate::install_python(version = \"[version number]\", force = TRUE)\n   ``` \n\n2. If you would like to keep that installation of Python then use a different version number:\n   ```r\n    reticulate::install_python(version = \"[slightly different version number]\")\n   ``` \n    For example, if the version number is `3.9.12`, then use `3.9.18`: \n  \n    ```r\n    reticulate::install_python(version = \"3.9.18\")\n    ``` \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n##  `spark_connect()` returns `! Version '14.2' does not exist`\n\nError message contains: \n\n```r\n  Checking if provided version is valid against PyPi.org\n  Error in `install_environment()`\n  ! Version '14.2' does not exist\n```\n\nThis happens when `pysparklyr` gets the cluster DBR version automatically. Usually\nwhen running `spark_connect()` or `install_databricks()`. This occurs because\nthe latest version of DBR, as of today 14.2, is ahead of what the `databricks.connect`\nversion available in `databricks.connect`.\n\n### Solution\n\nCurrent workdaround is to say \"No\" when prompted to install version 14.2. And if \nmissing in your machine, install 14.1 using: \n\n```r\npysparklyr::install_databricks(\"14.1\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Environments\n\n### Install different version of `databricks.connect`\n\nHere are three different options to create a custom Python environment, that\nwill contain the needed Python libraries to interact with Databricks Connect:\n\n- To install the latest versions of all the needed libraries, use:\n  ```r\n  pysparklyr::install_databricks()\n  ```\n  `sparklyr` will query PyPi.org to get the latest version of `databricks.connect`\n  and installs that version. \n\n\n- It is recommended that the version of the `databricks.connect` library, matches \nthe DBR version of your cluster.   To do this, pass the DBR version in the\n`version` argument, for example:\n  ```r\n  pysparklyr::install_databricks(\"14.0\")\n  ```\n  This will create a Python environment and install `databricks.connect` version\n  14.0, and it will automatically name it `r-sparklyr-databricks-14.0`.  By using\n  this name, `sparklyr` is able to know what version of `databricks.connect` is\n  available inside this particular Python environment.\n\n- If you are not sure about the version of the cluster you want to interact with,\nthen use the `cluster_id` argument. We have added a way to pull the cluster's\ninformation, without starting a Spark connect. This allows us to query the\ncluster and get the DBR version:\n\n  ```r\n  pysparklyr::install_databricks(cluster_id = \"[Your cluster's ID]\")\n  ```\n\n### Restricted Python environments \n\nIf your organization restricts Python environment creation, you can \npoint `sparklyr` to the designated Python installation.  To do this, pass the\npath to the environment in the `envname` argument of `spark_connect()`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(sparklyr)\n\nsc <- spark_connect(\n  method = \"databricks_connect\",\n  cluster_id = \"Enter here your cluster ID\",\n  envname = \"Enter here the path to your Python environment\"\n)\n```\n\nTo successfully connect to a Databricks cluster, you will need to match the\nproper version of the `databricks.connect` Python library, to the Databricks\nRuntime (DBR) version in the cluster. For example, if you are trying to use a\nDatabricks cluster with a DBR version 14.0, then `databricks.connect` will also\nneed to be version 14.0. Failure to do so, can result in instability, or even\nthe inability to connect. \n\nBesides `datbricks.connect`, the Python environment will also need to have other\nPython libraries installed. The full list is in the [Additional setup details](#additional-setup-details)\nsection.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nIf your server, or machine, has only one Python installation and, no ability to create\nConda or Virtual environments, then you will encounter issues when connecting to\na Databricks cluster with a mismatched version of `databricks.connect` to DBR.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**Important** -  This step needs only to be **done one time**. If you need to connect to a different\ncluster, but that has the same DBR version, `sparklyr` will use the same\nPython environment.  If the new cluster has a different DBR version, then it is\nrecommended that you run the installation function using the new DBR version, or\ncluster ID.\n\n### Python Libraries\n\nHere is the list of the Python libraries needed in order to work with the cluster:\n\nRequired libraries: \n\n- `databricks-connect`\n- `delta-spark` \n- `pandas`\n- `PyArrow`\n- `grpcio`\n- `google-api-python-client`\n- `grpcio_status`\n\nML libraries (Optional): \n\n- `torch` \n- `torcheval`\n- `scikit-learn`\n\n## Deploying to Posit Connect\n\nTODO\n\n## What is supported\n\nHere is a list of what we currently support, and do not support via\n`sparklyr` and Connect:\n\n**Supported**:\n\n-   Integration with most of the `dplyr`, and `DBI`, APIs\n-   Integration with the `invoke()` command\n-   RStudio Connections Pane navigation\n-   Support for Personal Access Token security authentication for\n    Databricks Connect\n-   Support for most read and write commands. These have only been\n    tested in Spark Connect.\n\n**Not supported**:\n\n-   **ML functions** - All functions, in `sparklyr`, that have the `ml_`\n    and `ft_` are currently not supported. The reason is that Spark 3.4\n    does not currently support MLlib. We expect that some ML support\n    will be available in Spark 3.5. At that time we will work on\n    integrating the new ML routines from Connect into `sparklyr`.\n\n-   **SDF functions** - Most of these functions require SparkSession,\n    which is currently not supported in Spark 3.4.\n\n-   **`tidyr`** - This is ongoing work that we are focusing on in\n    `sparklyr`. We are implementing these functions using PySpark\n    DataFrame commands, instead of depending on the Scala\n    implementation.\n\n",
