## sdf_weighted_sample

## Description
Draw a random sample of rows (with or without replacement) from a Spark DataFrame If the sampling is done without replacement, then it will be conceptually equivalent to an iterative process such that in each step the probability of adding a row to the sample set is equal to its weight divided by summation of weights of all rows that are not in the sample set yet in that step.


## Usage
```r
sdf_weighted_sample(x, weight_col, k, replacement = TRUE, seed = NULL)
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | An object coercable to a Spark DataFrame. |
| weight_col | Name of the weight column |
| k | Sample set size |
| replacement | Whether to sample with replacement |
| seed | An (optional) integer seed |
