<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This documentation demonstrates how to use <code>sparklyr</code> with a Databricks cluster
in the context of RStudio Server Pro, RStudio Connect and RStudio Package
Manager.</p>
</div>
<div id="best-practices" class="section level2">
<h2>Best practices</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain separate installation environments</strong> - Install RStudio Server Pro,
RStudio Connect, and RStudio Package Manager outside of the Databricks cluster
so that they are not limited to the resources or ephemeral nature of
Databricks clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Connect to Databricks remotely</strong> - Work with Databricks as a remote compute
resource in RStudio Server Pro, similar to how you would connect remotely to
external databases, data sources, and storage systems. This can be
accomplished using Databricks Connect for Spark as described in the
<a href="#option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely">Connecting to Databricks remotely</a>
section below, or by using the
<a href="https://docs.rstudio.com/pro-drivers/">RStudio Professional Drivers</a> for Hive
and Impala.</li>
<li><strong>Restrict workloads to interactive analysis</strong> - Only perform workloads
related to exploratory or interactive analysis with Spark, then write the
results to a database, file system, or cloud storage for more efficient
retrieval in apps, reports, and APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Load and query results efficiently</strong> - Because of the nature of Spark
computations and the associated overhead, Shiny apps that use Spark on the
backend tend to have performance and runtime issues; consider reading the
results from a database, file system, or cloud storage instead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options for using RStudio Server Pro with Databricks</h2>
<p>There are two options for using <code>sparklyr</code> and RStudio Server Pro with
Databricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1:
<a href="#option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely">Connecting to Databricks remotely</a>
(Recommended Option)</li>
<li>Option 2:
<a href="#option-2---working-inside-of-databricks">Working inside of Databricks</a>
(Alternative Option)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely" class="section level2">
<h2>Option 1 - Connecting to Databricks remotely</h2>
<p>With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Spark
cluster and allows users to connect to Spark remotely using
<a href="https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html">Databricks Connect</a>.</p>
<p>This is the recommended configuration because it targets separate environments,
involves simpler configuration, avoids resource contention, and allows RStudio
Server Pro to connect to Databricks as well as other remote storage and compute
resources.</p>

<div id="option-2---working-inside-of-databricks" class="section level2">
<h2>Option 2 - Working inside of Databricks</h2>
<p>If you cannot work with Spark remotely, you should install RStudio Server Pro on
the Driver node of a long-running, persistent Databricks cluster as opposed to a
worker node or an ephemeral cluster.</p>
<p>With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed on the Spark driver
node and allows users to work locally with Spark.</p>
<p>This configuration can result in increased complexity, limited connectivity to
other storage and compute sources, resource contention between RStudio Server
Pro and Databricks, and maintenance concerns due to the ephemeral nature of
Databricks clusters.</p>

<div id="using-rstudio-connect-with-databricks" class="section level2">
<h2>Using RStudio Connect with Databricks</h2>
<p>The server environments in Databricks clusters are not permissive enough to
support RStudio Connect or the process sandboxing mechanisms that it uses for
published content. Therefore, the only supported configuration is to install
RStudio Connect outside of the Databricks cluster.</p>
<p>There are two options for using <code>sparklyr</code> and RStudio Connect with Databricks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>By connecting to Databricks remotely using
<a href="https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html">Databricks Connect</a>
(Recommended Option)</li>
<li>By adding calls in your R code to create and run Databricks jobs
<a href="https://github.com/RafiKurlansik/bricksteR/">via the Databricks REST API</a>
(Alternative Option)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="using-rstudio-package-manager-with-databricks" class="section level2">
<h2>Using RStudio Package Manager with Databricks</h2>
<p>Whether RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Databricks cluster
(Recommended Option) or within the Databricks cluster, you can install packages
from repositories in RStudio Package Manager as long as HTTP/HTTPS network
traffic is allowed from RStudio Server Pro to RStudio Package Manager.</p>
