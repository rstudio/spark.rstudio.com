The column should be single vector column of numeric values. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| label_col | Label column name. The column should be a numeric column. Usually this column is output by `ft_r_formula`. |\n| prediction_col | Prediction column name. |\n| probability_col | Column name for predicted class conditional probabilities. |\n| raw_prediction_col | Raw prediction (a.k.a. confidence) column name. |\n| k | The number of clusters to create |\n| max_iter | The maximum number of iterations to use. |\n| seed | A random seed. Set this value if you need your results to be reproducible across repeated calls. |\n| input_col | The name of the input column. |\n| input_cols | Names of output columns. |\n| output_col | The name of the output column. |\n| thresholds | Thresholds in multi-class classification to adjust the probability of predicting each class. Array must have length equal to the number of classes, with values > 0 excepting that at most one value may be 0. The class with largest value `p/t` is predicted, where `p` is the original probability of that class and `t` is the class's threshold. |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
