## gf_triangle_count

## Description
This algorithm ignores edge direction; i.e., all edges are treated as undirected. In a multigraph, duplicate edges will be counted only once.


## Usage
```r
gf_triangle_count(x, ...)
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| x | An object coercable to a GraphFrame (typically, a `gf_graphframe`). |
| ... | Optional arguments, currently not used. |








## Examples
```r


g <- gf_friends(sc)
gf_triangle_count(g)


```
