These functions will 'force' any pending SQL in a `dplyr` pipeline, such that the resulting `tbl_spark` object returned will no longer have the attached 'lazy' SQL operations. Note that the underlying Spark DataFrame **does** execute its operations lazily, so that even though the pending set of operations (currently) are not exposed at the `R` level, these operations will only be executed when you explicitly `collect()` the table. \n\n\n\n\n## See Also\nOther Spark data frames:  `sdf_copy_to()`, `sdf_distinct()`, `sdf_random_split()`, `sdf_register()`, `sdf_sample()`, `sdf_weighted_sample()`\n\n\n\n\n",
