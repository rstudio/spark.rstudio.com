## Overview

If the recommended path of connecting to Spark remotely with Databricks Connect
does not apply to your use case, then you can install RStudio Server Pro
directly within a Databricks cluster.

With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed on the Spark driver
node and allows users to work locally with Spark.

This configuration can result in more complex configuration, limited
connectivity to other storage and compute sources, resource contention between
RStudio Server Pro and Databricks, and maintenance concerns due to the ephemeral
nature of Databricks clusters.

For additional details, refer to the
[FAQ for RStudio in the Databricks Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/sparkr/rstudio.html#frequently-asked-questions-faq).

## Advantages and limitations

Advantages:

- Can load data from the cluster since RStudio Server Pro is installed within
  the Databricks cluster

Limitations:

- If the Databricks cluster is restarted or terminated, then the instance of
  RStudio Server Pro will be terminated and its configuration will be lost
- If users do not persist their code through version control or the Databricks
  File System, then you risk losing user's work if the cluster is restarted or
  terminated
- RStudio Server Pro (and other RStudio products) installed within a Databricks
  cluster will be limited to the resources and lifecycle of that particular
  Spark cluster
- Non-Spark jobs will use CPU and RAM resources within the Databricks cluster
- Need to install one instance of RStudio Server Pro per Spark cluster that you
  want to run jobs on

## Requirements

- Databricks Runtime 4.1 or above
- The cluster must not have "table access control" or "automatic termination" enabled
- You must have "Can Attach To" permission for the Databricks cluster

## Preparation

The following steps walk through the process to install RStudio Server Pro
on the Spark driver node within your Databricks cluster.

The recommended method for installing RStudio Server Pro to the Spark driver
node is via SSH. However, an alternative method is available if you are not able
to access the Spark driver node via SSH.

## Configure SSH access to the Spark driver node

Configure SSH access to the Spark driver node in Databricks by following the
steps in the [SSH access to clusters section of the Databricks Cluster
configurations
documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/configure.html#ssh-access-to-clusters).

**Note:** If you are unable to configure SSH access or connect to the Spark
driver node via SSH, then you can follow the steps in the [Get started with
RStudio Server Pro section of the RStudio on Databricks
documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/sparkr/rstudio.html#get-started-with-rstudio-server-pro)
to install RStudio Server Pro from a Databricks notebook, then skip to the
section on "Using sparklyr".

## Connect to the Spark driver node via SSH

Connect to the Spark driver node via SSH on port 2200 by using the following
command on your local machine:

```
ssh ubuntu@<spark-driver-node-address> -p 2200 -i <path-to-private-SSH-key>
```

Replace `<spark-driver-node-address>` with the DNS name or IP address of the
Spark driver node, and `<path-to-private-SSH-key>` with the path to your private
SSH key on your local machine.

## Install RStudio Server Pro on the Spark driver node

After you SSH into the Spark driver node, then you can follow the steps to
[install RStudio Server Pro in the RStudio documentation](https://docs.rstudio.com/rsp/installation/).
In the installation steps, you can select Ubuntu as the target Linux
distribution.

## Configure RStudio Server Pro

The following configuration steps are required to be able to use RStudio Server
Pro with Databricks.

Add the following configuration lines to `/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf` to use
proxied authentication with Databricks and enable the administrator dashboard:

```
auth-proxy=1
auth-proxy-user-header-rewrite=^(.*)$ $1
auth-proxy-sign-in-url=<domain>/login.html
admin-enabled=1
```

Add the following configuration line to `/etc/rstudio/rsession-profile` to set
the `PATH` to be used with RStudio Server Pro:

```
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:$PATH
```

Add the following configuration lines to `/etc/rstudio/rsession.conf` to
configure sessions in RStudio Server Pro to work with Databricks:

```
session-rprofile-on-resume-default=1
allow-terminal-websockets=0
```

Restart RStudio Server Pro:

```
sudo rstudio-server restart
```

## Access RStudio Server Pro

From the Databricks console, click on your Databricks cluster:

Click on the `Apps` tab:

Click on the link to open RStudio Server Pro:

If you configured proxied authentication in RStudio Server Pro as described in
the previous section, then you do not need to use the username or password that
is displayed. Instead, RStudio Server Pro will automatically login and start a
new RStudio session as your logged-in Databricks user:

## Configuring `sparklyr`

Use the following R code to establish a connection from `sparklyr` to the
Databricks cluster:

```
SparkR::sparkR.session()
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(method = "databricks")
```
