## Overview

This documentation demonstrates how to use `sparklyr` with RStudio Server Pro
and a Databricks cluster with Apache Spark.

## Best practices

- **Maintain separate installation environments** - Install RStudio Server Pro,
  RStudio Connect, and RStudio Package Manager outside of the Databricks cluster
  so that they are not limited to the resources or ephemeral nature of
  Databricks clusters
- **Connect to Databricks remotely** - Work with Databricks as a remote compute
  resource in RStudioÂ Server Pro, similar to how you would connect remotely to
  external databases, data sources, and storage systems
- **Restrict workloads to interactive analysis** - Only perform workloads
  related to exploratory or interactive analysis with Spark, then write the
  results to a database, file system, or cloud storage for more efficient
  retrival in apps, reports, and APIs
- **Load and query results efficiently** - Because of the nature of Spark
  computations and the associated overhead, Shiny apps that use Spark on the
  backend tend to have performance and runtime issues; consider reading the
  results from a database, file system, or cloud storage instead

## Options for using RStudio with Databricks

There are two different options for using `sparklyr` with Databricks:

- Option 1:
  [Connecting to Databricks remotely](#option-1---connecting-to-databricks-remotely)
  (Recommended option)
- Option 2:
  [Working inside of Databricks](#option-2---working-inside-of-databricks)
  (Alternative option)

## Option 1 - Connecting to Databricks remotely

With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed outside of the Spark
cluster and allows users to connect to Spark remotely using
[Databricks Connect](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html).

This is the recommended configuration because it targets separate environments,
involves simpler configuration, avoids resource contention, and allows RStudio
Server Pro to connect to Databricks as well as other remote storage and compute
resources.

## Option 2 - Working inside of Databricks

If you cannot work with Spark remotely, you should install RStudio Server Pro on
the Driver node of a long-running, persistent Databricks cluster as opposed to a
worker node or an ephemeral cluster.

With this configuration, RStudio Server Pro is installed on the Spark driver
node and allows users to work locally with Spark.

This configuration can result in increased complexity, limited connectivity to
other storage and compute sources, resource contention between RStudio Server
Pro and Databricks, and maintenance concerns due to the ephemeral nature of
Databricks clusters.
